{"original": "The progress of Fus\u014d 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the Fus\u014d @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired .
